<h1>Welcome to the world of tech and programming.</h1>

<p>
Even at this moment, 10 lines of codes are being written by developers all over the world.
For a second 10 lines of code are written!!! 
That really is an astonishing fact. 
Something even more jaw dropping is that google, the widespread search engine is made by thousands of developers who had written 2 billion lines of code to make google the #1 search engine of the world. 
The world is now moving towards tech and it sure is a fact that one should have the fundamental knowledge of programming and cyber aspects.
Now we will give a try on improving your cyber life by explaining you some concepts of app development and also about certain programming languages.
At last as a bonus, we will show you a demo of  an app one of our fellow friend Bala has developed through his knowledge of programming.
</p>
  
<h2>Now lets start</h2>

<p>
First every application you see or use has 2 parts the frontend and the backend. 
For easy understanding it can be compared to the human body. 
The brain says you to lift a pen and your arm does it but you can't see the brain or the messages it sends that easily.
The brain is like the backend and the arm is like the frontend.
What you see while you use an app is the frontend and the backend is usually a server. 
A server is a piece of computer hardware or software that provides functionality for other programs or devices, called "clients". 
Here the client is the mobile app.
Okay. So now we have explained the basic structure of a mobile app.
So what does it takes to develop a mobile app? It is programming languages and markup languages. So now we shall see them
To build the frontend of mobile apps there are many languages.
As android is the most used OS worldwide, lets take the case of android apps.
For android apps, the frontend is usually made of xml and java. Some people use flutter a new programming language for app development as it is easier than xml or java.
Flutter is actually a combination of various languages like swift, dart and more...
</p>


<h2>Now lets look at xml</h2>

<p>
XML is a markup language. 
XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language. 
Markup langages cannot be considered as programming languages
</p>

<p> 
A markup language is slightly different from a programming language
A programming language like C sharp, C++, Java, Kotlin, Python etc:- will allow you to define behaviors, interactions, and conditions. 
A markup language is used more to describe data
Programming languages create dynamic interactions,
whereas markup languages generally handle static things like user interfaces.
Now we shall look at java and kotlin the programming languages primarily used by android app developers worldwide
</p>

<p>
Java is a high-level programming language originally developed by Sun Microsystems and now owned by the famous BaaS company oracle.
It was originally designed for developing programs for set-top boxes and handheld devices, but later became a popular choice for creating web and android apps.
The Java syntax is similar to C++, but is strictly an object-oriented programming language. 
In java there are more classes than any other programming language.
</p>

<p>
Kotlin is a newcommer in the world of high level programming languages.
Kotlin is a general purpose, free, open source, programming language initially designed for the Java Virtual Machine and Android.
Kotlin is a great language that combines object-oriented and functional programming features. It is focused on safety, clarity, and tooling support.
Thats why tech giants and FAANG use kotlin for their android apps.
It's very likely that Kotlin will be the primary programming language for Android in the future. 
However, while pretty much everyone agrees that Kotlin is the better language, most people , even experienced kotlin developers recommend to still start with Java as a beginner. 
But most consider for beginners C is the ideal choice.
</p>

<h2>Now backend.</h2>

<p>
When we come to backend, we have to know that database is the most important concept of backends. 
Most android apps use NoSql databases.
</p>

<p>
NoSql means not only SQL .SQL is Structured Query Language.Sql databases are usually relational tables.
NoSql databases are non tabular, and store data differently than relational tables.
</p>

<p>
NoSQL databases come in a variety of types based on their data model. The main types are document, key-value, wide-column, and graph. 
They provide flexible schemas and scale easily with large amounts of data and high user loads.
</p>

<p>
Commonly the most used Nosql db is firebase - a cloud based NoSql BaaS. BaaS means Backend - as - a - Service.
Firebase is a BaaS offered by google for developers to store and sync data realtime
Firebase stores data in the format of JSON, a tree like structure made of curly braces. JSON stands for Java Script Object Notation
</p>

<p>
Javacript is another programming language which is used to write cloud functions to firebase servers.
Google Cloud Functions is a serverless execution environment for building and connecting cloud services like firebase.
With Cloud Functions one can write simple, single-purpose functions that are attached to events emitted from the cloud infrastructure and services. 
The function is triggered when the related event being watched is fired.
</p>

<p>
As we use the android framework for android apps, we need to learn some other important concepts of android
</p>

<p>
Manifest file:- Every app project must have an AndroidManifest.xml file at the root of the project.
The manifest file describes essential information about your app to the Android build tools, the Android operating system, and Google Play.
</p>

<p>
Android studio:- Android Studio is the official integrated development environment for Google's Android operating system,
built on JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA software and designed specifically for Android development.
A surprising fact is that android studio itself was written on java, kotlin and the evergreen c++
</p>

<p>
Gradle: Gradle is a build automation tool for multi-language software development. 
It controls the development process in the tasks of compilation and packaging to testing, deployment, and publishing.
</p>

<p>
SDKs: SDK stands for software development kit or devkit for short.
SDK tools will include a range of things, including libraries, documentation, code samples, processes, and guides that developers can use and integrate into their own apps. 
SDKs are designed to be used for specific platforms or programming languages.
</p>

<h2>Now you may ask a question why are android apps better than other apps like ios and web apps</h2>

<p>
The major thing is android’s high presence on mobiles, because it is a big deal in terms of reachability.
At the end, in a competitive economic field, as mobile devices market, it’s amazing that one company owns the 84% of the market share of mobile operating systems.
So yes, the main advantage is that you can develop apps for almost 2 billion monthly active users.
</p>

<p>
Developing apps in Android it’s cheaper than in other platforms. The company provides its SDK for free, so all the costs are destinated to the app testing and deploying. That means you don’t have to make a big investment in that part.
Investing less on your app development means that you’ll have a higher ROI and your project will be more profitable.
</p>

<p>
Apple makes apps focused on premium customers with higher incomes. That certainly limits their offer of products and gives Android a whole field of opportunities for people with less incomes.
Android developers have the opportunity of making apps according to every kind of mobile device, either if they’re standard quality or high quality.
</p>

<p>
It is easy to integrate Android apps with popular social networks. For example, Android has the advantage of being part of the most used e-mailing platform on earth, Gmail.
According to Apps Chopper, in India, Android app developers render the best User Experiences for easy sign-in access with the app functionality.
Most Android apps give you the option of signing-in directly with your Facebook, Google or Twitter account.
</p>

<p>
Software developers, commonly learn to develop in Java, and it is easier for them to adapt to that programming language for mobile app development. 
Android is built mostly in Java, so its adaptation becomes faster and easier.
Android also has support for other programming languages and tools like c++ and kotlin, giving app developers more options and ways to build their projects.
</p>

<h2>Everything in the world isn't perfect. Android also has some cons lets look at them</h2>

<p>
There are a many android devices with different resolutions and screen sizes to take care of. This makes the app design and UI development much more challenging.
Android development teams should take this into account if they want to deliver a responsive app design that runs seamlessly across many devices, 
as well as to assess the impact of launching new features since a malfunction on a device can prevent users from running the app as anticipated. 
This is why there are so many apps of poor quality in the Play Store.
Given the multiple Android devices and versions,developers have to spend more time to thoroughly test apps on all models.
Cost. Due to the fragmentation and a large amount of testing required, it may cost more to develop in this platform but it is the cheapest when compared to other platforms.
Still, it depends on the app’s complexity.
</p>

<p>
We hope that you have been given some knowledge on programming and app development and android by us.
Now it is time for the demonstration of Bala's app
</p>

<p>
This app is called ChattrBox Indian Chat and is a chatting app with almost every feature of whatsapp
</p>

<p>
The languages used for this app are kotlin, gradle, java, xml and json and the database is of course firebase
</p>

<p>
This app is safe due to its strong encryption in server side and it uses google's servers located in US.
</p>

<p>
The advantage of this app is groups can contain 2 billion participants. Also it supports very high quality one to one video and voice calls from anywhere to anywhere.
